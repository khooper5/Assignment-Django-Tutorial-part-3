For each of the timestamps I copied the code from vs code and labeled timestamp section they came from, and then I have my entire studybud file uploaded so that you can see the final changes that were made all the way up to the last timestamp. As I did not go back to update the previous timestamps. Becasue I was unsure of if that was what was needed to be done, so I have uploaded my study bud file and the timestamps for the assignment.
